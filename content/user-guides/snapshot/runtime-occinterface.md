## Presentation :

OCCInterface is a generic application that lets you explore and modify the resources of an OCCI server.

Its aims are multiple:
- give a productivity tool to developers calling the OCCI API
- easily manage and explore resources of an OCCI server
- vulgarize, explain OCCI to newcomers, diffuse the OCCI way of thinking
- be an (executable) reference documentation of capabilities of an OCCI implementation or of an integration of OCCI clouds, thanks to [executable REST samples](https://github.com/occiware/OCCInterface/blob/master/src/readings/GettingStarted.md).

_[Live Demo on Heroku](http://occinterface.herokuapp.com/)_
