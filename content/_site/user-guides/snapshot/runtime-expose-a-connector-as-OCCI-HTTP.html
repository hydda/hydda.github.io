<h2 id="expose-a-connector-as-an-occi-http-api-">Expose a connector as an OCCI HTTP API :</h2>
<p>NB. implementing a connectorâ€™s (<strong>TODO</strong> at least ?) occiRetrieve is required in order for it to run inside erocci-dbus-java.</p>

<p>Follow <a href="https://github.com/occiware/occiware-ozwillo/blob/master/connector-analytics/README.md">steps described in the Linked Data demo</a> in order to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>create your own runtime project extending erocci-dbus-java and including your connector, then start it,</li>
  <li>expose it by building erocci, then starting it with DBus for erocci-dbus-java,</li>
  <li>check it by cloning, building, starting and using OCCInterface (generic OCCI playground).</li>
</ul>
