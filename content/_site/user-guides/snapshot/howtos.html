<ul>
  <li>
    <p>model a <strong>boolean attribute</strong> : <a href="https://github.com/erocci/erocci/issues/85">for now not supported in erocci</a>, rather use an Enum. Which is actually a good practice from a semantic point of view (example : having a VM.isStarted attribute and later discovering that there are additional lifecycle states besides started and stopped).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>model <strong>complex types</strong> : for now not supported <a href="https://github.com/erocci/erocci/issues/45">in OCCI</a> nor <a href="https://github.com/occiware/ecore/issues/130">in the Cloud Designer</a>, instead design additional resource kinds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/occiware/ecore/issues/128">link / drag and drop between configurations</a>, ex. to link a platform component to the infrastructure Compute whose host / IP it has</p>
  </li>
