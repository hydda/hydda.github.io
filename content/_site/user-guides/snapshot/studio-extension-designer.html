<p>When <a href="studio-new-occi-extension.html">you create a new OCCI extension</a>, it is directly
open in a graphical editor.</p>

<p>This modeler allows you to create new elements for your extension.<br />
For instance to attach a kind to its parent you can use the <em>parent edge tool</em>.<br />
You can also set the parent in the property view, in the <strong>Semantic tab</strong>.</p>

<p>There is also a textual syntax for OCCI, which can be useful for quick editing like search and replace.<br />
To view an OCCI model as text, simply double click on it (both .occic &amp; .occie are recognized).</p>

<p>When the extension is ready to use, you can check its correctness by validating it.
To achieve it, right-click in the background of the diagram and select <strong>Validate</strong>.
Then you can register the .occie file in order to use the extension in other models like configurations.</p>
